My Odin Calculator

Hey there! This is my **Calculator Project**, the final challenge for the Foundations path of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## What I used:
- **Clean HTML5:** Structuring the buttons and the display.
- **CSS3:** Making it look like a calculator I'd actually want to use.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** - Using **Objects** (my `Library`) to keep the math organized.
  - **Arrow functions** for clean, modern code.
  - **DOM Manipulation** to capture every click.
  - **Logic & State:** Managing variables so the calculator "remembers" what you typed.
