**🎮 Features**
Core Operations: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Decimal Support: Precision handling for decimal calculations.

Display Logic: Dynamic screen that updates as you type and clears upon calculation.

Error Handling: Prevents "scientific disasters" like dividing by zero.

**🛠 Tech Stack**

HTML5: Structured using a clean grid of buttons and a display screen.

CSS3: Custom-styled with a professional aesthetic, using Flexbox or CSS Grid for perfect button alignment.

JavaScript (ES6): Implements the logic for operations, managing the display state, and handling "order of operations" bugs.

**🧠 What I Learned**

The Calculator was the ultimate test of my logic. I mastered:

The "Logic Flow": How to store the first number, wait for the operator, and then execute the math when the second number is entered.

Edge Cases: Learning how to prevent users from typing multiple decimal points or breaking the UI with long numbers.
